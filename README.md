Modpacks made by me, some unfinished, others almost finished

AetherisMC - Genesis 2

It is a continuation of the AetherisMC - Genesis modpack, it was made in 1.19, the purpose of the modpack was to take advantage of the new versions, with some recipes changed to give more immersion in the game.

- Based around extended crafting for hard recipes


AMC - Expert 1.20

It was supposed to be an expert modpack based on CREATE, but due to lack of ideas and time its development was stopped. However, it has some scripts.
- It was supposed to be a skyfactory modpack


Underground Odissey

This modpack was supposed to be cave themed, where you only have a world full of caves, without minerals, and you need to evolve to seek technological supremacy!
- The idea initially came from my group of friends, but as time went by I became discouraged from finishing it.


Projetin Doido 1.20.1

This modpack was started in 2023 with the intention of having many recipes changed, with endgame focused on EMC, taking advantage of the new versions of the mods. But never finished.
- There are some of custom items, but due to the new version I decided to migrate and abandon this project.
- Initial Age of the modpack are based on create and its addons


Expert 1.21

The idea of ​​this modpack is to have many altered recipes, making the most of all the new and old mods, with a lot of focus on justdirethings and Modern Industrialization, it is still in development, and I am waiting for more mods to come out so I can continue with the project.
- This modpack is still in development, but I'm waiting for new mods to be able to continue with the idea.
- The idea is to be more based on just dire things, using its transformation mechanics to make early, mid and late game items.
- I dynamically added items from justdirethings to modern industrialization (see screenshots)


I have other modpacks that were developed by me in version 1.12.2 and below, but they were lost along with my old HD that corrupted all the files.

The proof that they existed and were out there is on youtube, and on technic (god forbid) the modpack name was "AetherisMC - Sky" and "AetherisMC - SkyHard"

I'm not proud to put it on a platform that doesn't help mod creators, but since it's a project from a few years ago, I removed it completely from technic (download), leaving only a reminder of the number of installations (only the modpack page is there with the download count).
